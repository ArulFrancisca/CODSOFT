# 🌸 Task 2 — Iris Flower Classification

This task focuses on building a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species:

- **Setosa**
- **Versicolor**
- **Virginica**

The dataset was cleaned using **Excel**, and the model was developed in **Python** using scikit-learn.  
Multiple models were trained and compared based on their accuracy.
